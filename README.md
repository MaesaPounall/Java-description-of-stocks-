# Java-description-of-stocks-
The code contained in this repository is written in Java on VsCode. This code was built as a fun project to track the major statistics of different stocks/crypto currencies using object oriented programming. EXCLAIMOR: All prices and ratios refrenced in all of the code are taken and based off of American currency (USD), conversions will be needed if Canadian currency (CAD) is the currency of your choice.
